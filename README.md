This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Study.io - EdTech Web Application

## Overview

Study.io is an educational technology (EdTech) web application designed to empower users with course ideas to share their knowledge by creating and uploading courses. The platform allows users to register, create courses, and manage their content seamlessly. The project was built using Next.js for the frontend, Material-UI (MUI) for styling and components, and Strapi as the backend CMS (Content Management System).

### Development Process

1. Key Sections and AI Assistance
   Defining Interfaces: AI helped define TypeScript interfaces for course data, user data, and API responses.

Troubleshooting Errors: AI was used to debug and resolve issues during development.

Styling: AI provided guidance on using MUI components effectively and ensuring a consistent design.

Error Handling: AI assisted in implementing initial error handling for API requests and user interactions.

API Integration: AI ensured the correct usage of Strapi endpoints and proper filtering of responses.

2. Main Sources of Help
   Strapi Documentation: Both written documentation and the Strapi AI chatbot were used extensively.

YouTube: Tutorials and guides for Next.js, MUI, and Strapi.

DeepSeek: AI assistance for coding, debugging, and best practices.

### Installation and Setup

Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or higher)

npm or yarn
