# Study.io - EdTech Web Application

## Overview

**Study.io** is an educational technology (EdTech) web application designed to empower users with course ideas to share their knowledge by creating and uploading courses. The platform allows users to register, create courses, and manage their content seamlessly. The project was built using **Next.js** for the frontend, **Material-UI (MUI)** for styling and components, and **Strapi** as the backend CMS (Content Management System).

### Development Process

1. Key Sections and AI Assistance

Defining Interfaces: AI helped define TypeScript interfaces for course data, user data, and API responses.

Troubleshooting Errors: AI was used to debug and resolve issues during development.

Styling: AI provided guidance on using MUI components effectively and ensuring a consistent design.

Error Handling: AI assisted in implementing initial error handling for API requests and user interactions.

API Integration: AI ensured the correct usage of Strapi endpoints and proper filtering of responses.

2. Main Sources of Help
   Strapi Documentation: Both written documentation and the Strapi AI chatbot were used extensively.

YouTube: Tutorials and guides for Next.js, MUI, and Strapi.

DeepSeek: AI assistance for coding, debugging, and best practices.
